## Linear Algebra PageRank algorithm

This is a demonstration/implementation of the PageRank algorithm, which contributed to Google's success by ranking pages on the web for their search engine. Made as part of the Linear Algebra course fall 2024 at IT-University of Copenhagen. 

### Prerequisties 

You will need the Go programming language to run this program:

- [Go Programming Language](https://go.dev/doc/install)

### How to run 

The program takes a command-line argument with the example data sets provided in /PageRankExampleData.

1. From the repository root, run `main.go` and the file name. Examples 

    ```
     go run main.go
     go run main.go bigRandom.txt
    ```

If no argument is given the default data set will be p2p-Gnutella08-mod.txt.
